# MINING FOR GOLD OR CRYPTO ?


## KEY QUESTIONS:

- In 2020, was the rise in Bitcoin driven by macroeconomic measures or speculation?

- How has Bitcoin/Ethereum perform against Gold and major market indices (i.e. NASDAQ, DOW JONES, TSX, etc)? 

- How do cryptocurrencies relate to foreign exchange rates for emerging economies? 

- How does Bitcoin compare to other cryptocurrencies (i.e. Altcoinâ€™s, Ethereum, Ripple, etc)?

- Are retail or institutional investors driving up cryptocurrency prices in 2020? 

- Is Bitcoin the new digital gold?  


## HYPOTHESIS: 
- Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are inversely related to economic growth

- Countries with FX volatility are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies 

- Institutional investors prefer Bitcoin to Gold as a natural hedge during economic uncertainty 

- Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have performed similarly

  General increase in cryptocurrency investment since July 2020. The larger returns in Ethereum are likely due to the increasing trends in blockchain/smart contract technology   and DeFi projects using Ethereum blockchain
